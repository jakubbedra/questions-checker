Stakeholders include each subject not necessary animate that has the right to influence the constructed system. We name the stakeholder and we describe what he expects from the system.\n\n4.

Other cooperating systems: domain of cooperation, shared or called functions (API), interfaces, data formats, shared data.\n\n5. Scope of functionality - general listing of individual functions available to users.\n\n6. Quality requirements - requirements formulated in a specific, measurable way, but without imposing specific solutions.\n\n7.

It represents a behavioral unit in a physical system.\nThe decisions about physical deployment of the system: how will the system be deployed on target devices. Deployment diagrams may be used.\nIdentification and handling of global resources: Resources such as files and data in databases. There are different methods used for synchronized access to the resources, such as guardian objects (slow but safe) or locks (fast, but may cause a deadlock).\nCorner case handling:\n-> Initialization - Transition from inactive state to stabilized running state of the system. \n-> Termination - Transitioning from the running state to inactive state. It includes: freeing the resources, deleting non persisted objects, systematic ending of tasks which are dependent on each other.\n-> Downfall - unexpected system termination. As far as possible, its cause and system state should be described.\n\nChoosing data container management solutions: Data containers might be used as an interface between the systems or as resources enabling shared usage of information.\n\nDecisions on the design style and developing compromise solutions.\n",

      "wrongUserAnswer": "My old man is a fishing fanatic. Half of the apartment is covered with fishing rods, that's the worst. On average, once a month someone steps on a hook or anchor lying on the ground and they have to be pulled out in the hospital because they have barbs at the end. In my twenty-two years of life, I have had this procedure 10 times. A week ago I went for some random tests, and as soon as the woman at the reception saw me, she told me to take off my shoes xD because she thought I had a hook in my leg again.\n\nThe other half of the apartment is full of \"Wędkarz Polski\", \"Świat Wędkarza\", \"Super Karp\" xD, etc. Every week my father goes to all the kiosks in the city to collect all the weekly fishing magazines. I was stupid enough to teach him about the Internet, because I thought we would save some money on these leaflets, but now he not only buys them, but also sits on some fishing forums and argues with other anglers about the best baits, etc. He can scream at the monitor or throw the keyboard out the window. Once my father pissed me off, so I created an account there and trolled him, writing random stupid things like \"crucians eat crap\". My mother couldn't keep up with cooking bigos to calm herself down. Oh, he already has the rank of SUM on the forum, for making 10,000 posts.\n\n",
