What parameter of G does the procedure return?\n2. How should it be modified in order for the execution time to be asymptotically as short as possible?\n",
      "sampleAnswer": "1. We count all paths of the length of 2, which are found between the vertices that are connected by an edge. At the end we divide the number by 3. That means, this procedure returns the number of triangles (C3) in a graph G. Dividing by 3 is the result of each triangle having 3 of such vertices.\n2. In order for the execution time to be asymptotically as short as possible, we might use a fast matrix multiplication, using for instance Strassen method, which has the complexity of O(n^log{2}(7))\n",

It represents a behavioral unit in a physical system.\nThe decisions about physical deployment of the system: how will the system be deployed on target devices. Deployment diagrams may be used.\nIdentification and handling of global resources: Resources such as files and data in databases. There are different methods used for synchronized access to the resources, such as guardian objects (slow but safe) or locks (fast, but may cause a deadlock).\nCorner case handling:\n-> Initialization - Transition from inactive state to stabilized running state of the system. \n-> Termination - Transitioning from the running state to inactive state. It includes: freeing the resources, deleting non persisted objects, systematic ending of tasks which are dependent on each other.\n-> Downfall - unexpected system termination. As far as possible, its cause and system state should be described.\n\nChoosing data container management solutions: Data containers might be used as an interface between the systems or as resources enabling shared usage of information.\n\nDecisions on the design style and developing compromise solutions.\n",
