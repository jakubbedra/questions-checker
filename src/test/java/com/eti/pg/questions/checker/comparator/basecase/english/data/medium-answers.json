      "question": "What actions (name at least 4 steps) should be taken according to TDD (Test Driven Development), when a software bug was reported?\n",
      "sampleAnswer": "1. create a test case, which will not be met for a situation specific for the reported bug.\n2. run the tests and make sure they do not pass.\n3. remove the bug from the code.\n4. run the tests and check if they give a positive result, if not, return to step 3.\n5. share the fixed version with the user.\n",
      "correctUserAnswer": "1. Write a test scenario covering the newly found bug.\n2. Make sure it does not pass.\n3. Find and fix the cause of the bug.\n4. Run the test and make sure it passes.\n5. If the test did not pass, we need to make further fixes.\n",

      "sampleAnswer": "c) periodically: in the scope of a sprint, each day a new point is added to the chart\nd) we planned the sprint too pessimistically\n",
      "correctUserAnswer": "c) the chart is created periodically, once per sprint. Each day of the sprint we add a new point.\nd) it means that the sprint was estimated too pessimistically.\n",
      "wrongUserAnswer": "c) the chart is created once\nd) it means that the sprint ended before the given end time. In that case, we immediately proceed to the next sprint and we cut down the chart.\n",

      "question": "What is created in reverse engineering: new software versions or patches/fixes? Name the goal of reverse engineering.\n",
      "sampleAnswer": "None of them. The goal of reverse engineering is not creating software. It’s goal is to reconstruct the analytical and project documentation.\n",
      "correctUserAnswer": "In the scope of reverse engineering neither new software version nor a patch is created. It’s goal is the recreation of the analytical and project documentation of already existing software.\n",
      "wrongUserAnswer": "System versions. Reverse engineering means creating code for an already existing system.\n",

      "correctUserAnswer": "1. Locate bad smell\n2. Write tests covering the use cases of the code which will be refactored and make sure they pass.\n3. Choose a refactorization mechanism.\n4. Do the refactorization.\n5. Make sure, the tests still pass.\n6. Repeat until the smell is removed.\n",

      "sampleAnswer": "1. We count all paths of the length of 2, which are found between the vertices that are connected by an edge. At the end we divide the number by 3. That means, this procedure returns the number of triangles (C3) in a graph G. Dividing by 3 is the result of each triangle having 3 of such vertices.\n2. In order for the execution time to be asymptotically as short as possible, we might use a fast matrix multiplication, using for instance Strassen method, which has the complexity of O(n^log{2}(7))\n",

      "wrongUserAnswer": "1. This method returns the number of vertices divided by 3.\n2. We assume, that the number of vertex is given as input, so in that case we can just skip the for loop and divide the number of vertices by 3\n",
