      "question": "Describe Ohm's Law and explain its significance in electrical circuits.\n",
      "sampleAnswer": "Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electronics and electrical engineering, stating that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across those points and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. It is usually expressed by the equation I=V/R, where I is the current in amperes, V is the voltage in volts, and R is the resistance in ohms. This law is crucial for designing and analyzing electrical circuits, as it helps in understanding how voltage, current, and resistance are interrelated. By using Ohm's Law, one can predict the behavior of electrical circuits, determining the current flow for a given voltage and resistance, or vice versa.\n",
      "correctUserAnswer": "Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electronics and electrical engineering, which states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. This relationship is represented by the formula I= V/R, where I represents the current in amperes, V is the voltage in volts, and R is the resistance in ohms. Ohm's Law is significant because it provides a basic yet powerful formula for understanding and calculating how voltage, current, and resistance interact in an electrical circuit. This law is essential for designing, analyzing, and troubleshooting electrical and electronic circuits, as it helps predict the behavior of these circuits under various conditions. By knowing any two of the three quantities (voltage, current, resistance), the third can be calculated, enabling engineers and technicians to design circuits that function efficiently and safely.\n",

      "question": "What is the difference between present simple and present continuous?\n",
      "sampleAnswer": "The present simple and present continuous are two different verb tenses in English, each used to express different types of actions or states.\n         Present Simple: This tense is used to describe habitual actions, general truths, or facts that are always true. It is formed using the base form of the verb (or the base form + \"s\" for he/she/it). For example, \"She reads books every night,\" indicating a regular action.\n         Present Continuous: This tense is used to describe actions that are currently happening at the moment of speaking or temporary actions. It is formed using the auxiliary verb \"to be\" (am/is/are) + verb-ing (the base form of the verb + \"ing\"). For example, \"She is reading a book right now,\" indicating an action happening at this moment.\nThe key difference lies in the time frame and nature of the actions: present simple for regular, habitual actions or general truths, and present continuous for actions happening currently or temporarily.\n",
      "correctUserAnswer": "The present simple tense is used for habitual or regular actions, general truths, and facts, such as \"He plays football every weekend.\" On the other hand, the present continuous tense is used for actions that are happening at the moment of speaking or for temporary situations, as in \"He is playing football right now.\" The present simple is formed using the base form of the verb, while the present continuous is formed with \"to be\" + the base verb ending in \"-ing.\"\n \n",

      "question": "Describe what was Thirty Years’ War.\n",
      "sampleAnswer": "The Thirty Years' War was one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in European history, lasting from 1618 to 1648. Fought primarily in Central Europe, an estimated 4.5 to 8 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of battle, famine, and disease, while some areas of modern Germany experienced population declines of over 50%. Related conflicts include the Eighty Years' War, the War of the Mantuan Succession, the Franco-Spanish War, the Torstenson War, the Dutch-Portuguese War and the Portuguese Restoration War.\n\nThe war was traditionally viewed as a continuation of the religious conflict initiated by the 16th-century Reformation within the Holy Roman Empire. The 1555 Peace of Augsburg attempted to resolve this by dividing the Empire into Lutheran and Catholic states, but over the next 50 years the expansion of Protestantism beyond these boundaries destabilised the settlement. However, while modern commentators accept differences over religion and Imperial authority were important factors in causing the war, they argue its scope and extent were driven by the contest for European dominance between Habsburg-ruled Spain and Austria, and the French House of Bourbon.[20]\n\nIts outbreak is generally traced to 1618,[m] when Emperor Ferdinand II was deposed as king of Bohemia and replaced by the Protestant Frederick V of the Palatinate. Although Imperial forces quickly suppressed the Bohemian Revolt, his participation expanded the fighting into the Palatinate, whose strategic importance drew in the Dutch Republic and Spain, then engaged in the Eighty Years' War. Rulers like Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden also held territories within the Empire, giving them and other foreign powers an excuse to intervene. The result was to turn an internal dynastic dispute into a broader European conflict.\n\nThe first phase from 1618 until 1635 was primarily a civil war between German members of the Holy Roman Empire, with support from external powers. After 1635, the Empire became one theatre in a wider struggle between France, supported by Sweden, and Emperor Ferdinand III, allied with Spain. This concluded with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, whose provisions included greater autonomy within the Empire for states like Bavaria and Saxony, as well as acceptance of Dutch independence by Spain. The conflict shifted the balance of power in favour of France, and set the stage for the expansionist wars of Louis XIV which dominated Europe for the next sixty years.\n",
      "correctUserAnswer": "The Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) was one of the longest and most complex armed conflicts in European history. It originated from a religious conflict in Bohemia, which escalated into a major war with a pan-European scope. The war had its roots in the conflict between Catholics and Protestants, intensifying after the Prague Defenestration in 1618.\n\nThe main phases of the war included battles in Bohemia, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and France. The diverse range of participants, including Catholic and Protestant states, introduced political and religious complexity to the conflict. The war concluded with the Peace of Westphalia treaties signed in 1648, establishing new boundaries and principles of international conduct.\n\nThe Thirty Years' War had tragic consequences, including massive destruction, famine, and epidemics that afflicted Central Europe.

      "sampleAnswer": "The Defenestrations of Prague (Czech: Pražská defenestrace, German: Prager Fenstersturz, Latin: Defenestratio Pragensis) were three incidents in the history of Bohemia in which people were defenestrated (thrown out of a window). Though already existing in Middle French, the word defenestrate (\"out of the window\") is believed to have first been used in English in reference to the episodes in Prague in 1618 when the disgruntled Protestant estates threw two royal governors and their secretary out of a window of the Hradčany Castle and wrote an extensive apologia explaining their action. In the Middle Ages and early modern times, defenestration was not uncommon—the act carried elements of lynching and mob violence in the form of murder committed together.\n\nThe first governmental defenestration occurred in 1419, the second in 1483 and the third in 1618, although the term \"Defenestration of Prague\" more commonly refers to the third. Often, however, the 1483 event is not recognized as a \"significant defenestration\", which leads to some ambiguity when the 1618 defenestration is referred to as the \"second Prague defenestration\". The first and third defenestrations helped to trigger a prolonged religious conflict inside Bohemia (the Hussite Wars, 1st defenestration) or beyond (Thirty Years' War, 3rd defenestration), while the second helped establish a religious peace in the country for 31 years (Peace of Kutná Hora, 2nd defenestration).\n",

A crowd of Hussite protesters stormed the town hall, demanding religious reforms. During the confrontation, some councillors sympathetic to the Hussite cause were thrown out of the window. This event is considered a precursor to the Hussite Wars.\n\n\tSecond Defenestration (1618): The more famous defenestration occurred on May 23, 1618, also at Prague Castle. In this instance, two Catholic officials were thrown out of a window by Protestant nobles during a meeting of the Bohemian Estates. This act of defiance was a response to perceived anti-Protestant actions by the Catholic Habsburg rulers. The Second Defenestration of Prague is often regarded as the immediate cause of the Bohemian Revolt and the subsequent outbreak of the Thirty Years' War.\n\nThe term \"defenestration\" specifically refers to the act of throwing someone out of a window. The Defenestrations of Prague hold historical significance due to their role in shaping the religious and political landscape of Central Europe during the late medieval and early modern periods.\n",
      "wrongUserAnswer": "The Defenestrations of Prague were extraordinary events where people decided that windows were the best mode of transportation. In the first defenestration in 1419, some folks got upset during a meeting, so they decided to take a scenic exit out of the Prague Castle windows. It was like a team-building exercise but with more gravity.\n\nFast forward to the second defenestration in 1618 - this time, Catholic officials went airborne courtesy of Protestant nobles. Apparently, windows were the preferred mode of inter-religious communication in Prague. The act became a viral sensation among Bohemian Estates.\n\nIn essence, defenestration is a Bohemian tradition of saying goodbye with style, embracing the philosophy that gravity is just a suggestion. These events, fueled by a passion for unconventional exits, inadvertently set the stage for historical dramas like the Bohemian Revolt and the Thirty Years' War.\n",
